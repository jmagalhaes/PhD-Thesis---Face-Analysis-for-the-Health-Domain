\chapter{Research Methods}

The previous chapter gave an overview of the research done in affect detection, \gls{behaviomedics}, and multimodal data fusion. Based on the state-of-the-art, the goal is to create a multimodal framework to analyze the relationship of emotions, expressed emotions, and speech errors. For that purpose, experts need to be consulted in order to gain more insights of motoric speech disorders and to have access to patients. In chapter~\ref{sec:experts} institutions are listed which can be approached for that matter. Whilst contact is built with the experts, available datasets shown in chapter~\ref{subsec:availableData} can be used to build a multimodal framework. In chapter~\ref{subsec:collectedData} collected data of 67 children will be described, as well as the risen challenges to analyze the data.
Subsequent the creation of a new multimodal dataset of exercises performed by \gls{pws} or patients with \gls{pd} or \gls{ad} suffering \gls{apraxia} or \gls{dysarthria} is described. 
The chapter ends with an overview of sensors which can be used for data collection and the features which can be used in each modality. 

\section{Expertise Consulting}
\label{sec:experts}
As the proposed project is interdisciplinary, it is necessary to create contacts to medical centers where expertise about \gls{stuttering}, \gls{dysarthria} and \gls{apraxia} caused by underlying neurodegenerative diseases can be found.

Expertise in dysfluency can be found at the \textbf{Stuttering Center of Western Pennsylvania} which is located in Pittsburgh. It works in collaboration with the Department of Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of \gls{upmc} and the Department of Communication Science and Disorders at the University of Pittsburgh. It is an institution which is open to research concerning stuttering. 
%Dr. J. Scott Yaruss, Director of the Stuttering Center, is the responsable contact for research cooperations (jsyaruss@pitt.edu).

At the \textbf{\gls{upmc} Voice Center} voice disorders are evaluated and treated for both the general public and those who use their voices professionally. One of the therapies which are provided is the "Lee Silverman Voice Treatment". It is a proven speech treatment program for people with \gls{pd}. It helps restore oral communication beyond what current medicines and surgical interventions can offer. At the UPMC Voice Center, a modified version of this program is provided, focusing on increasing vocal loudness, enhancing sensory awareness of disordered movement parameters, and "re-calibrating" the sensorimotor system for appropriate movement dynamics.
The UPMC Voice Center also participates in several research studies such as in "defining the Minimal Clinically Important Difference of the Voice Handicap Index-10". The goal of this study is to find out how a change in patient-perceived voice handicap correlates with clinical improvement in voice. 

Additional information can be obtained from the \textbf{Department of Neurology of the University of Pittsburgh}, where several neurodegenerative diseases causing movement disorders are treated \footnote{
\url{http://www.neurology.upmc.edu/movement/}}. Furthermore, it has been designated by the American Parkinson Disease Association (APDA) \footnote{ \url{https://www.apdaparkinson.org}} as one of only eight Advanced Centers for Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Research in the nation.

\section{Datasets}

\subsection{Creation of Baseline with Available Multimodal Datasets}
\label{subsec:availableData}
Available datasets will be used to create baselines for emotion classification. The RECOLA multimodal corpus used in the AVEC 2016 emotion sub-challenge contains data of remote and collaborative affective interactions. It contains audio-visual and physiological data for emotion recognition. To create a multimodal baseline, toolboxes mentioned in \ref{sec:sensorsFeatures} will be used to create hand-crafted features. The features will be used for unimodal supervised classification as well as for data fusion and multimodal supervised classification.  The results can be evaluated using the F1-score, precision and recall.

As baseline to detect distress, anxiety and depression, the DAIC-WOZ database \footnote{ \url{http://dcapswoz.ict.usc.edu/wwwutil_files/DAICWOZDepression_Documentation.pdf}} from AVEC 2016 will be used. It contains clinical interviews designed to support the diagnosis of psychological distress conditions such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder \cite{Valstar2016avec}. The same methods will be applied as for the first dataset.

The creation of a multimodal baseline using existing datasets has several advantages. Time is saved in data collection, several researchers used the datasets and results and methods are published, and implementation mistakes can be detected through comparison with the results of other researchers.


\subsection{Collected Dataset}
\label{subsec:collectedData}
In October and November of 2016, preliminary recordings were performed using a Microsoft Kinect v2 to record 67 children between the ages of 7 -11 during the performance of oromotoric exercises. The recordings were performed in two different elementary schools in Lisbon, always in a room of the school (see setup in Fig.~\ref{fig:setup}). Children without any prior knowledge of detected speech or language disorders were recorded. The exercises were chosen by the \glspl{slp} shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:recordedEx} and were guided by 4 of them. In order to meet the anonymity requirements by the ethics committee, a black bar was placed over the eyes. 
The children had to perform each exercise in isolation and then performed rapid alternations between two exercises as can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:recordedSeq}.

Challenges in the data: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Unusual movements were difficult to perform:} Although the exercises were explained and demonstrated prior to execution, movements which involved lip movement to the sides as well as jaw movements were not always performed correctly. Haptic feedback was given by touching the cheek or the jaw to guide the movement direction, but was not always enough.
    \item \textbf{Order of the exercises was not fixed:} There are variations in the order of the exercises, as well as interruptions. Exercises needed to be interrupted as the children lost concentration as well as to talk to them and gain some trust. The order of the exercises was not always the same, which implies a manual labeling of the data for exercises, and removal of frames in which the \gls{slp} was talking to the child.
    \item \textbf{Variations in the explanation:} Explanation of exercises as well as how often it was repeated or how it was reformulated various in each \gls{slp}. 
    \item \textbf{Repetition frequency varies:} Some children repeated the exercises more often than others.
\end{itemize}
 The mentioned challenges difficult the analysis of the exercise performance. However, it can be used to test geometric feature detection in 3D data.

\subsection{Creation of own Dataset}
\label{subsec:newData}
With the support of the experts mentioned, experimental protocols will be designed to collect data, e.g., from stutterers as well as from health subjects as control group. The goal is to create an experimental protocol which can easily be reproduced. For this purpose the indication of the exercises should be recorded or come from an computerized assistant which is displayed on a monitor to facilitate labeling of the data. After each exercise the subject will be asked to give feedback on his emotional state by filling in a questionnaire. Data will be recorded using a combination of the devices shown in \ref{sec:sensorsFeatures}. Stuttering occurrence as well as prolongations can be labeled manually also by non-experts.

To have data over a longer period of time, subjects could be accompanied during their therapies. For the stuttering case it can be justified to monitor the progress of a stuttering therapy supported by emotional biofeedback. For that purpose two groups would be recorded. Subjects of the first group, would perform the exercises without emotional biofeedback and the second group with. After each exercise the subject would provide feedback on their emotional state.
